			<h3>Me In A Nutshell</h3>
				<p>I was born at Jefferson Hospital, December 20th, 1991. Growing up in Northeast Philadelphia, I developed a love for Philadelphia sports and the local music scene while in grade school and high school. Unsure of what career path I would take in life, I became interested in learning how to code and following web development as a career. After hearing about the <em>New York Code and Design Academy</em> through my sister, I decided to apply to the Web Development Intensive course which began on November 30th, 2015.</p>

			<h3>Interests</h3>
			<p>There are many interests I have but the strongest of them are coding, music, TV, and sports. Being a life long 4 for 4 fan of Philadelphia sports, every new season brings excitement as to what could happen. During the last few months I have gotten in web development and the fun that it can be. I enjoy the process of building a project and seeing the finished product while trying to improve it in anyway that I can. The Web Development Intensive is doing a great job at helping my skills improve.</p>

			<h3>Other Facts</h3>
				<p>I've been playing a handful of different instruments from an early age, starting with piano and branching out to guitar, bass, drums, etc. Regarding television, I am an avid fan of shows such as <em>Breaking Bad</em>, <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>, and <em>Fargo</em>. For the past three a half years I've worked security for Penn State University, Abington campus. I intend to finish the WDI and hopefully land a good job afterwards.</p>
